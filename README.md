# Welcome To My Profile
 I wrote the following websites.
 - https://www.boolean-algebra.com
   
   &mdash; Learn boolean algebra. Insert a boolean expression into my tool and it will give detailed conversions and steps to simplify.
 - https://www.sql-practice.com
 
   &mdash; Practice SQL in the browser. You are provided with a demo database and you are provided with a question to solve. Write a query to solve the problem.
 - https://www.compareminds.com
 
   &mdash; A site I wrote to learn Vue.js. Play mental games and compare your results with the rest of the world.

I suggest checking out my [Ajax Intercepter](https://github.com/000744210/Ajax-Intercepter) browser extension. It allows you to intercept all xhr/websockets/htmlform network requests. You can read and edit the body/headers/url or reject the packet. I use it to test website for vulnurabilitys. I have found most of my vulnurabilitys with this extension.

All of my websites are hosted using GitPages. All processing is done on the browser without the need of a server.

I focus on efficiency and cost reduction. Hosting currently costs $0.00 and supports up to approximately 300,000 monthly unique people. 

All of my main repositories are privated, sorry.
