# Welcome To My Profile
 I wrote the following websites.
 - https://www.boolean-algebra.com
   
   &mdash; Learn boolean algebra. Insert a boolean expression into my tool and it will give detailed conversions and steps to simplify.
 - https://www.sql-practice.com
 
   &mdash; Practice SQL in the browser. You are provided with a demo database and you are provided with a question to solve. Write a query to solve the problem.
 - https://www.compareminds.com
 
   &mdash; A site I wrote so I can learn Vue.js. Play mental games and compare your results with the rest of the world.

I suggest checking out my [Ajax Intercepter](https://github.com/000744210/Ajax-Intercepter) browser extension. It allows you to intercept all xhr/websockets/htmlform network requests. You can read and edit the body/headers/url or reject the packet. I use it to test websites for vulnerabilities. I have found most of my vulnerabilities with this extension.

All of my websites are hosted using GitPages and proxied through CloudFlare. All processing is done on the browser without the need of a server.

I focus on efficiency and cost reduction. Hosting currently costs $0.00 and supports up to approximately 500,000 monthly unique people before a different host is required. 

Most of my main repositories are privated, most of the public repositories are compiled source code, sorry.
